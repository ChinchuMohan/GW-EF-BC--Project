# Groundwater contribution to environmental flows

This repository contains the workflow of Mohan et al. (in review). **Quantifying groundwater's contribution to regional environmental flows in diverse hydrologic landscapes** Pre print: doi 10.1002/essoar.10511792.1 

The repository will be organised into three folders: 1) preprocessing/estimation, 2) analysis, 3) plotting

## Project description
In this study we develop two methods for estimating groundwater contribution to environmental flows: 1) a groundwater-centric method and 2) a surface water-centric method. The two methods are demonstrated using the western province of Canada, British Columbia as a case study. The framework presented in this study can be implemented across different spatial and temporal scales for different regions and globally, in data-scarce, hydrologically complex landscapes.
